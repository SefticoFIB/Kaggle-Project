## Introduction
Credit card fraud is a significant issue that affects both cardholders and financial institutions. This project aims to build an effective fraud detection system using various machine learning models. The models are evaluated based on multiple performance metrics.

## Dataset
The dataset used for this project is the "Credit Card Fraud Detection" dataset, which can be found on [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/ealtman2019/credit-card-transactions).

## Results
The project evaluates various machine learning models including Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, Random Forest, and Gradient Boosting. The performance of these models is compared using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and the F1 score.
