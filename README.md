## Introduction 🚀
Credit card fraud is a significant issue that affects both cardholders and financial institutions. This project aims to build an effective fraud detection system using various machine learning models. The models are evaluated based on multiple performance metrics.

## Dataset 📊
The dataset used for this project is the "Credit Card Fraud Detection" dataset, which can be found on [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/ealtman2019/credit-card-transactions).

## Results 📈
The project evaluates various machine learning models including Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, Random Forest, and Gradient Boosting. The performance of these models is compared using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and the F1 score.
